# ml_lifecycle_framework

For now, this repository serves as a Kotlin playground for me in a data science/engineering, machine learning and <br>
MLOps environment. It provides a versatile machine learning pipeline that includes various algorithms. <br>
The framework is designed to seamlessly handle tasks such as ingesting and preprocessing data, fitting a model, <br> 
and performing predictions.

I used the **Smile** Java library to implement some classification algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Ada Boost
- Gradient Boost

... and **KotlinDL** for a Deep Learning Classifier.

Further used libraries:
- **Kotlin DataFrame**
  - for data preprocessing
- **Azure SDK** (Java)
  - for data storage
