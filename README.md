# ml_lifecycle_framework

For now, this repository serves as a Kotlin playground for me in a data science, machine learning and data engineering environment.
It provides a versatile machine learning pipeline that includes various algorithms. The framework is designed to seamlessly handle
tasks such as ingesting and preprocessing data, fitting a model, and performing predictions.

I used the Smile library to implement some classification algorithms
- Logisitic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Ada Boost
